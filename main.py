        Management should investigate the reasons further: maybe Webshop doesn't efficiently convey price reductions to customers or the timing for price reductions is wrong.
        Research has shown that more than a half of orders contain discounted items. Customers prefer to buy Cosmetics, Luggage and Footwear on sale.
        This behavior should be investigated further. As customers might create their shopping basket around Apparel, Traditional or Footwear item and impulsively add passing accessories and shoes, if they have a discount. In this case it might be beneficial to offer personal discounts on accessories and shoes, if specific apparel clothing is in the shopping basket.</div>
