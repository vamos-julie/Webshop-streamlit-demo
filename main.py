        <div>Something seems odd with the pricing strategy because only 18 products were sold after being discounted. Management should investigate the reasons further: perhaps Webshop doesn't efficiently convey price reductions to customers, or the timing for price reductions is incorrect.
        Research has shown that more than half of orders contain discounted items. Customers prefer to buy Cosmetics, Luggage, and Footwear on sale. This behavior should be investigated further. Customers might create their shopping basket around Apparel, Traditional, or Footwear items and impulsively add passing accessories and shoes if they have a discount. In this case, it might be beneficial to offer personalized discounts on accessories and shoes if specific apparel clothing is in the shopping basket.</div>
